Introduction

In this project, I used data from the Stack Overflow Survey 2024. This is a survey data which I took from their website. This data contains nearly 65,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the Data Science Blog Post.ipynb file.

For my analyis, I focused on answering the following five questions:

1. Do Professional Developers Consider AI To Be A Threat?
2. What Is The Work Model Of Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat?
3. How Many Years of Experience Do Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat Have?
4. What Is The Level of Education Of Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat?
5. What Country Are Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat From? (Top 10)

Result Summary

After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:

1. The majority of professional developers do not consider AI to be a threat.
2. Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily work remotely.
3. Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily have less than 10 years of experience.
4. Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily have a bachelor's degree.
5. Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily come from the United, followed by India, and then Germany.
