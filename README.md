# Data-Science-Blog-Post

### Motivation

The motitvation for this project stems from the fact that AI is increasingly becoming apart of our daily lives, from the use of Chat GPT to self-driving cars. As a result, many are concerned that AI could take over jobs that some humans do, particularly those in software development. Therefore, I was wondering what software developers think of AI and whether they feel threatened by it.

### Libraries

The code for this project is contained in the 'Data_Science_Blog_Post.ipynb' file in this repository. To be able to run it, please install the install the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### Data

For this project, I used data from the Stack Overflow Survey 2024. This data contains nearly 65,000 responses from over 170 countries. To download the data, please click here and use the 'survey_results_public.csv' file (https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

### Questions

For this project, I focused on answering the following questions about developers and AI:

* Do Software Developers Feel Threatened By AI?
* What Is The Work Model Of Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat?
* How Many Years of Experience Do Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat Have?
* What Is The Level of Education Of Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat?
* What Country Are Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat From? (Top 10)?

### Results

Here are the results of the analysis:

* The majority of professional developers do not consider AI to be a threat.
* Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily work remotely.
* Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily have less than 10 years of experience.
* Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily have a bachelor's degree.
* Those professional developers who consider AI to be a threat primarily come from the United, followed by India, and then Germany.
