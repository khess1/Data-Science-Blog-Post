# Data-Science-Blog-Post

### Motivation

The motitvation for this project stems from the fact that AI is increasingly becoming apart of our daily lives, from the use of Chat GPT to self-driving cars. As a result, many people are concerned that AI could take over jobs that some humans do, particularly those in software development. Therefore, I was wondering what software developers think of AI and whether they feel threatened by it.

### Libraries

The code for this project is contained in the 'Data_Science_Blog_Post.ipynb' file in this repository. To be able to run it, please install the install the following libraries:

* `NumPy`
* `Pandas`
* `Matplotlib`

### Data

For this project, I used data from the Stack Overflow Survey 2024. This data contains nearly 65,000 responses from over 170 countries. To download the data, please click [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) and use the `survey_results_public.csv` file.

### Questions

For this project, I focused on answering the following five questions:

1. Do Software Developers Feel Threatened By AI?
2. What Is The Work Model Of Software Developers Who Feel Threatened By AI?
3. How Many Years of Experience Do Software Developers Who Feel Threatened By AI Have?
4. What Is The Level of Education Of Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat?
5. What Country Are Those Professional Developers Who Consider AI To Be A Threat From? (Top 10)?

### Results

* The majority of software developers do not consider AI to be a threat.
* Software developers who feel threatened by AI primarily work remotely.
* Software developers who feel threatened by AI primarily have less than 10 years of experience.
* Software developers who feel threatened by AI primarily have a bachelor's degree.
* Software developers who feel threatened by AI primarily come from the United States, followed by India, and then Germany.
