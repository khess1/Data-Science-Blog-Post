Introduction

In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2024. This is a survey data which I took from their website. This data contains nearly 65,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the Data Science Blog Post.ipynb file.

For this analysis, I focused in answering these five questions:

1. Do Developers Find AI To Be A Threat?
2. For Those Developers Who Do Find AI To Be A Threat, What Country Are They From (Top 10)?
3. For Those Developers Who Do Find AI To Be A Threat, What Is There Working Model?
4. For Those Developers Who Do Find AI To Be A Threat, What Is Level of Education?
5. For Those Developers Who Do Find AI To Be A Threat, How Many Year of Experience Do They Have?

Result Summary

After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:

1. The majority of developers do not consider AI to be a threat.
2. Those developers that do consider AI to be a threat mostly come from the United States, followed by India, and then Germany.
3. Those developers that do consider AI to be threat mostly work remotely.
4. Those developers that do consider AI to be a threat mostly have bachelor's degrees.
5. Those developers that do consider AI to be a threat moslty have 10 or less years of experience.



Download the data and save the survey_results_public.csv file in the same directory with this notebook.
